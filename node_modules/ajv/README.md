## Please [sponsor Ajv development](https://github.com/sponsors/epoberezkin)

I will get straight to the point - I need your support to ensure that the development of Ajv continues.

I have developed Ajv for 5 years in my free time, but it is not  sustainable. I'd appreciate if you consider supporting its further development with donations:
- [GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/epoberezkin) (GitHub will match it)
- [Ajv Open CollectiveÔ∏è](https://opencollective.com/ajv)

There are many small and large improvements that are long due, including the support of the next versions of JSON Schema specification, improving website and documentation, and making Ajv more modular and maintainable to address its limitations - what Ajv needs to evolve is much more than what I can contribute in my free time.

I would also really appreciate any advice you could give on how to raise funds for Ajv development - whether some suitable open-source fund I could apply to or some sponsor I should approach.

Since 2015 Ajv has become widely used, thanks to your help and contributions:

- **90** contributors üèó
- **5,000** dependent npm packages ‚öôÔ∏è
- **7,000** github stars, from GitHub users [all over the world](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1MGRV8ciFUGIbO1l0EKFWNJGYE7iSkDxP&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C4.821737100000007&z=2) ‚≠êÔ∏è
- **5,000,000** dependent repositories on GitHub üöÄ
- **120,000,000** npm downloads per month! üíØ

I believe it would benefit all Ajv users to help put together the fund that will be used for its further development - it would allow to bring some additional maintainers to the project.

Thank you

## Using version 6

[JSON Schema draft-07](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html) is published.

[Ajv version 6.0.0](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v6.0.0) that supports draft-07 is released. It may require either migrating your schemas or updating your code (to continue using draft-04 and v5 schemas, draft-06 schemas will be supported without changes).

__Please note__: To use Ajv with draft-06 schemas you need to explicitly add the meta-schema to the validator instance:

```javascript
ajv.addMetaSchema(require('ajv/lib/refs/json-schema-draft-06.json'));
```

To use Ajv with draft-04 schemas in addition to explicitly adding meta-schema you also need to use option schemaId:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({schemaId: 'id'});
// If you want to use both draft-04 and draft-06/07 schemas:
// var ajv = new Ajv({schemaId: 'auto'});
ajv.addMetaSchema(require('ajv/lib/refs/json-schema-draft-04.json'));
```

## Performance

Ajv generates code using [doT templates](https://github.com/olado/doT) to turn JSON Schemas into super-fast validation functions that are efficient for v8 optimization.

Currently Ajv is the fastest and the most standard compliant validator according to these benchmarks:

- [json-schema-benchmark](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark) - 50% faster than the second place
- [jsck benchmark](https://github.com/pandastrike/jsck#benchmarks) - 20-190% faster
- [z-schema benchmark](https://rawgit.com/zaggino/z-schema/master/benchmark/results.html)
- [themis benchmark](https://cdn.rawgit.com/playlyfe/themis/master/benchmark/results.html)


Performance of different validators by [json-schema-benchmark](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark):

- draft-06/07 keywords `const`, `contains`, `propertyNames` and `if/then/else`
- draft-06 boolean schemas (`true`/`false` as a schema to always pass/fail).
- keywords `switch`, `patternRequired`, `formatMaximum` / `formatMinimum` and `formatExclusiveMaximum` / `formatExclusiveMinimum` from [JSON Schema extension proposals](https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/wiki/v5-Proposals) with [ajv-keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-keywords) package
- [$data reference](#data-reference) to use values from the validated data as values for the schema keywords
- [asynchronous validation](#asynchronous-validation) of custom formats and keywords

Currently Ajv is the only validator that passes all the tests from [JSON Schema Test Suite](https://github.com/json-schema/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite) (according to [json-schema-benchmark](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark), apart from the test that requires that `1.0` is not an integer that is impossible to satisfy in JavaScript).


## Install

```
npm install ajv
```


## <a name="usage"></a>Getting started

Try it in the Node.js REPL: https://tonicdev.com/npm/ajv


The fastest validation call:

```javascript
// Node.js require:
var Ajv = require('ajv');
// or ESM/TypeScript import
import Ajv from 'ajv';

var ajv = new Ajv(); // options can be passed, e.g. {allErrors: true}
var validate = ajv.compile(schema);
var valid = validate(data);
if (!valid) console.log(validate.errors);
```

or with less code

```javascript
// ...
var valid = ajv.validate(schema, data);
if (!valid) console.log(ajv.errors);
// ...
```

or

```javascript
// ...
var valid = ajv.addSchema(schema, 'mySchema')
               .validate('mySchema', data);
if (!valid) console.log(ajv.errorsText());
// ...
```

See [API](#api) and [Options](#options) for more details.

Ajv compiles schemas to functions and caches them in all cases (using schema serialized with [fast-json-stable-stringify](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify) or a custom function as a key), so that the next time the same schema is used (not necessarily the same object instance) it won't be compiled again.

The best performance is achieved when using compiled functions returned by `compile` or `getSchema` methods (there is no additional function call).

__Please note__: every time a validation function or `ajv.validate` are called `errors` property is overwritten. You need to copy `errors` array reference to another variable if you want to use it later (e.g., in the callback). See [Validation errors](#validation-errors)

__Note for TypeScript users__: `ajv` provides its own TypeScript declarations
out of the box, so you don't need to install the deprecated `@types/ajv`
module.


## Using in browser

You can require Ajv directly from the code you browserify - in this case Ajv will be a part of your bundle.

If you need to use Ajv in several bundles you can create a separate UMD bundle using `npm run bundle` script (thanks to [siddo420](https://github.com/siddo420)).

Then you need to load Ajv in the browser:
```html
<script src="ajv.min.js"></script>
```

This bundle can be used with different module systems; it creates global `Ajv` if no module system is found.

The browser bundle is available on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/ajv).

Ajv is tested with these browsers:

[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/epoberezkin.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/epoberezkin)

__Please note__: some frameworks, e.g. Dojo, may redefine global require in such way that is not compatible with CommonJS module format. In such case Ajv bundle has to be loaded before the framework and then you can use global Ajv (see issue [#234](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/234)).


### Ajv and Content Security Policies (CSP)

If you're using Ajv to compile a schema (the typical use) in a browser document that is loaded with a Content Security Policy (CSP), that policy will require a `script-src` directive that includes the value `'unsafe-eval'`.
:warning: NOTE, however, that `unsafe-eval` is NOT recommended in a secure CSP[[1]](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy#relaxing-eval), as it has the potential to open the document to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

In order to make use of Ajv without easing your CSP, you can [pre-compile a schema using the CLI](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli#compile-schemas). This will transpile the schema JSON into a JavaScript file that exports a `validate` function that works simlarly to a schema compiled at runtime.

Note that pre-compilation of schemas is performed using [ajv-pack](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-pack) and there are [some limitations to the schema features it can compile](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-pack#limitations). A successfully pre-compiled schema is equivalent to the same schema compiled at runtime.


## Command line interface

CLI is available as a separate npm package [ajv-cli](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli). It supports:

- compiling JSON Schemas to test their validity
- BETA: generating standalone module exporting a validation function to be used without Ajv (using [ajv-pack](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-pack))
- migrate schemas to draft-07 (using [json-schema-migrate](https://github.com/epoberezkin/json-schema-migrate))
- validating data file(s) against JSON Schema
- testing expected validity of data against JSON Schema
- referenced schemas
- custom meta-schemas
- files in JSON, JSON5, YAML, and JavaScript format
- all Ajv options
- reporting changes in data after validation in [JSON-patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) format


## Validation keywords

Ajv supports all validation keywords from draft-07 of JSON Schema standard:

- [type](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#type)
- [for numbers](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-numbers) - maximum, minimum, exclusiveMaximum, exclusiveMinimum, multipleOf
- [for strings](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-strings) - maxLength, minLength, pattern, format
- [for arrays](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-arrays) - maxItems, minItems, uniqueItems, items, additionalItems, [contains](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#contains)
- [for objects](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-objects) - maxProperties, minProperties, required, properties, patternProperties, additionalProperties, dependencies, [propertyNames](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#propertynames)
- [for all types](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-all-types) - enum, [const](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#const)
- [compound keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#compound-keywords) - not, oneOf, anyOf, allOf, [if/then/else](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#ifthenelse)

With [ajv-keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-keywords) package Ajv also supports validation keywords from [JSON Schema extension proposals](https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/wiki/v5-Proposals) for JSON Schema standard:

- [patternRequired](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#patternrequired-proposed) - like `required` but with patterns that some property should match.
- [formatMaximum, formatMinimum, formatExclusiveMaximum, formatExclusiveMinimum](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#formatmaximum--formatminimum-and-exclusiveformatmaximum--exclusiveformatminimum-proposed) - setting limits for date, time, etc.

See [JSON Schema validation keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md) for more details.


## Annotation keywords

JSON Schema specification defines several annotation keywords that describe schema itself but do not perform any validation.

- `title` and `description`: information about the data represented by that schema
- `$comment` (NEW in draft-07): information for developers. With option `$comment` Ajv logs or passes the comment string to the user-supplied function. See [Options](#options).
- `default`: a default value of the data instance, see [Assigning defaults](#assigning-defaults).
- `examples` (NEW in draft-06): an array of data instances. Ajv does not check the validity of these instances against the schema.
- `readOnly` and `writeOnly` (NEW in draft-07): marks data-instance as read-only or write-only in relation to the source of the data (database, api, etc.).
- `contentEncoding`: [RFC 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.1 ), e.g., "base64".
- `contentMediaType`: [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046), e.g., "image/png".

__Please note__:  Ajv does not implement validation of the keywords `examples`, `contentEncoding` and `contentMediaType` but it reserves them. If you want to create a plugin that implements some of them, it should remove these keywords from the instance.


## Formats

Ajv implements formats defined by JSON Schema specification and several other formats. It is recommended NOT to use "format" keyword implementations with untrusted data, as they use potentially unsafe regular expressions - see [ReDoS attack](#redos-attack).

__Please note__: if you need to use "format" keyword to validate untrusted data, you MUST assess their suitability and safety for your validation scenarios.

The following formats are implemented for string validation with "format" keyword:

- _date_: full-date according to [RFC3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).
- _time_: time with optional time-zone.
- _date-time_: date-time from the same source (time-zone is mandatory). `date`, `time` and `date-time` validate ranges in `full` mode and only regexp in `fast` mode (see [options](#options)).
- _uri_: full URI.
- _uri-reference_: URI reference, including full and relative URIs.
- _uri-template_: URI template according to [RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570)
- _url_ (deprecated): [URL record](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url).
- _email_: email address.
- _hostname_: host name according to [RFC1034](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.5).
- _ipv4_: IP address v4.
- _ipv6_: IP address v6.
- _regex_: tests whether a string is a valid regular expression by passing it to RegExp constructor.
- _uuid_: Universally Unique IDentifier according to [RFC4122](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122).
- _json-pointer_: JSON-pointer according to [RFC6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).
- _relative-json-pointer_: relative JSON-pointer according to [this draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-luff-relative-json-pointer-00).

__Please note__: JSON Schema draft-07 also defines formats `iri`, `iri-reference`, `idn-hostname` and `idn-email` for URLs, hostnames and emails with international characters. Ajv does not implement these formats. If you create Ajv plugin that implements them please make a PR to mention this plugin here.

There are two modes of format validation: `fast` and `full`. This mode affects formats `date`, `time`, `date-time`, `uri`, `uri-reference`, and `email`. See [Options](#options) for details.

You can add additional formats and replace any of the formats above using [addFormat](#api-addformat) method.

The option `unknownFormats` allows changing the default behaviour when an unknown format is encountered. In this case Ajv can either fail schema compilation (default) or ignore it (default in versions before 5.0.0). You also can whitelist specific format(s) to be ignored. See [Options](#options) for details.

You can find regular expressions used for format validation and the sources that were used in [formats.js](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/compile/formats.js).


## <a name="ref"></a>Combining schemas with $ref

You can structure your validation logic across multiple schema files and have schemas reference each other using `$ref` keyword.

Example:

```javascript
var schema = {
  "$id": "http://example.com/schemas/schema.json",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "$ref": "defs.json#/definitions/int" },
    "bar": { "$ref": "defs.json#/definitions/str" }
  }
};

var defsSchema = {
  "$id": "http://example.com/schemas/defs.json",
  "definitions": {
    "int": { "type": "integer" },
    "str": { "type": "string" }
  }
};
```

Now to compile your schema you can either pass all schemas to Ajv instance:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({schemas: [schema, defsSchema]});
var validate = ajv.getSchema('http://example.com/schemas/schema.json');
```

or use `addSchema` method:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv;
var validate = ajv.addSchema(defsSchema)
                  .compile(schema);
```

See [Options](#options) and [addSchema](#api) method.

__Please note__:
- `$ref` is resolved as the uri-reference using schema $id as the base URI (see the example).
- References can be recursive (and mutually recursive) to implement the schemas for different data structures (such as linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.).
- You don't have to host your schema files at the URIs that you use as schema $id. These URIs are only used to identify the schemas, and according to JSON Schema specification validators should not expect to be able to download the schemas from these URIs.
- The actual location of the schema file in the file system is not used.
- You can pass the identifier of the schema as the second parameter of `addSchema` method or as a property name in `schemas` option. This identifier can be used instead of (or in addition to) schema $id.
- You cannot have the same $id (or the schema identifier) used for more than one schema - the exception will be thrown.
- You can implement dynamic resolution of the referenced schemas using `compileAsync` method. In this way you can store schemas in any system (files, web, database, etc.) and reference them without explicitly adding to Ajv instance. See [Asynchronous schema compilation](#asynchronous-schema-compilation).


## $data reference

With `$data` option you can use values from the validated data as the values for the schema keywords. See [proposal](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/51) for more information about how it works.

`$data` reference is supported in the keywords: const, enum, format, maximum/minimum, exclusiveMaximum / exclusiveMinimum, maxLength / minLength, maxItems / minItems, maxProperties / minProperties, formatMaximum / formatMinimum, formatExclusiveMaximum / formatExclusiveMinimum, multipleOf, pattern, required, uniqueItems.

The value of "$data" should be a [JSON-pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to the data (the root is always the top level data object, even if the $data reference is inside a referenced subschema) or a [relative JSON-pointer](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-luff-relative-json-pointer-00) (it is relative to the current point in data; if the $data reference is inside a referenced subschema it cannot point to the data outside of the root level for this subschema).

Examples.

This schema requires that the value in property `smaller` is less or equal than the value in the property larger:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({$data: true});

var schema = {
  "properties": {
    "smaller": {
      "type": "number",
      "maximum": { "$data": "1/larger" }
    },
    "larger": { "type": "number" }
  }
};

var validData = {
  smaller: 5,
  larger: 7
};

ajv.validate(schema, validData); // true
```

This schema requires that the properties have the same format as their field names:

```javascript
var schema = {
  "additionalProperties": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": { "$data": "0#" }
  }
};

var validData = {
  'date-time': '1963-06-19T08:30:06.283185Z',
  email: 'joe.bloggs@example.com'
}
```

`$data` reference is resolved safely - it won't throw even if some property is undefined. If `$data` resolves to `undefined` the validation succeeds (with the exclusion of `const` keyword). If `$data` resolves to incorrect type (e.g. not "number" for maximum keyword) the validation fails.


## $merge and $patch keywords

With the package [ajv-merge-patch](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-merge-patch) you can use the keywords `$merge` and `$patch` that allow extending JSON Schemas with patches using formats [JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) and [JSON Patch (RFC 6902)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902).

To add keywords `$merge` and `$patch` to Ajv instance use this code:

```javascript
require('ajv-merge-patch')(ajv);
```

Examples.

Using `$merge`:

```json
{
  "$merge": {
    "source": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": { "p": { "type": "string" } },
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    "with": {
      "properties": { "q": { "type": "number" } }
    }
  }
}
```

Using `$patch`:

```json
{
  "$patch": {
    "source": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": { "p": { "type": "string" } },
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    "with": [
      { "op": "add", "path": "/properties/q", "value": { "type": "number" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

The schemas above are equivalent to this schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "p": { "type": "string" },
    "q": { "type": "number" }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The properties `source` and `with` in the keywords `$merge` and `$patch` can use absolute or relative `$ref` to point to other schemas previously added to the Ajv instance or to the fragments of the current schema.

See the package [ajv-merge-patch](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-merge-patch) for more information.


## Defining custom keywords

The advantages of using custom keywords are:

- allow creating validation scenarios that cannot be expressed using JSON Schema
- simplify your schemas
- help bringing a bigger part of the validation logic to your schemas
- make your schemas more expressive, less verbose and closer to your application domain
- implement custom data processors that modify your data (`modifying` option MUST be used in keyword definition) and/or create side effects while the data is being validated

If a keyword is used only for side-effects and its validation result is pre-defined, use option `valid: true/false` in keyword definition to simplify both generated code (no error handling in case of `valid: true`) and your keyword functions (no need to return any validation result).

The concerns you have to be aware of when extending JSON Schema standard with custom keywords are the portability and understanding of your schemas. You will have to support these custom keywords on other platforms and to properly document these keywords so that everybody can understand them in your schemas.

You can define custom keywords with [addKeyword](#api-addkeyword) method. Keywords are defined on the `ajv` instance level - new instances will not have previously defined keywords.

Ajv allows defining keywords with:
- validation function
- compilation function
- macro function
- inline compilation function that should return code (as string) that will be inlined in the currently compiled schema.

Example. `range` and `exclusiveRange` keywords using compiled schema:

```javascript
ajv.addKeyword('range', {
  type: 'number',
  compile: function (sch, parentSchema) {
    var min = sch[0];
    var max = sch[1];

    return parentSchema.exclusiveRange === true
            ? function (data) { return data > min && data < max; }
            : function (data) { return data >= min && data <= max; }
  }
});

var schema = { "range": [2, 4], "exclusiveRange": true };
var validate = ajv.compile(schema);
console.log(validate(2.01)); // true
console.log(validate(3.99)); // true
console.log(validate(2)); // false
console.log(validate(4)); // false
```

Several custom keywords (typeof, instanceof, range and propertyNames) are defined in [ajv-keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-keywords) package - they can be used for your schemas and as a starting point for your own custom keywords.

See [Defining custom keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/CUSTOM.md) for more details.


## Asynchronous schema compilation

During asynchronous compilation remote references are loaded using supplied function. See `compileAsync` [method](#api-compileAsync) and `loadSchema` [option](#options).

Example:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ loadSchema: loadSchema });

ajv.compileAsync(schema).then(function (validate) {
  var valid = validate(data);
  // ...
});

function loadSchema(uri) {
  return request.json(uri).then(function (res) {
    if (res.statusCode >= 400)
      throw new Error('Loading error: ' + res.statusCode);
    return res.body;
  });
}
```

__Please note__: [Option](#options) `missingRefs` should NOT be set to `"ignore"` or `"fail"` for asynchronous compilation to work.


## Asynchronous validation

Example in Node.js REPL: https://tonicdev.com/esp/ajv-asynchronous-validation

You can define custom formats and keywords that perform validation asynchronously by accessing database or some other service. You should add `async: true` in the keyword or format definition (see [addFormat](#api-addformat), [addKeyword](#api-addkeyword) and [Defining custom keywords](#defining-custom-keywords)).

If your schema uses asynchronous formats/keywords or refers to some schema that contains them it should have `"$async": true` keyword so that Ajv can compile it correctly. If asynchronous format/keyword or reference to asynchronous schema is used in the schema without `$async` keyword Ajv will throw an exception during schema compilation.

__Please note__: all asynchronous subschemas that are referenced from the current or other schemas should have `"$async": true` keyword as well, otherwise the schema compilation will fail.

Validation function for an asynchronous custom format/keyword should return a promise that resolves with `true` or `false` (or rejects with `new Ajv.ValidationError(errors)` if you want to return custom errors from the keyword function).

Ajv compiles asynchronous schemas to [es7 async functions](http://tc39.github.io/ecmascript-asyncawait/) that can optionally be transpiled with [nodent](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent). Async functions are supported in Node.js 7+ and all modern browsers. You can also supply any other transpiler as a function via `processCode` option. See [Options](#options).

The compiled validation function has `$async: true` property (if the schema is asynchronous), so you can differentiate these functions if you are using both synchronous and asynchronous schemas.

Validation result will be a promise that resolves with validated data or rejects with an exception `Ajv.ValidationError` that contains the array of validation errors in `errors` property.


Example:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv;
// require('ajv-async')(ajv);

ajv.addKeyword('idExists', {
  async: true,
  type: 'number',
  validate: checkIdExists
});


function checkIdExists(schema, data) {
  return knex(schema.table)
  .select('id')
  .where('id', data)
  .then(function (rows) {
    return !!rows.length; // true if record is found
  });
}

var schema = {
  "$async": true,
  "properties": {
    "userId": {
      "type": "integer",
      "idExists": { "table": "users" }
    },
    "postId": {
      "type": "integer",
      "idExists": { "table": "posts" }
    }
  }
};

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

validate({ userId: 1, postId: 19 })
.then(function (data) {
  console.log('Data is valid', data); // { userId: 1, postId: 19 }
})
.catch(function (err) {
  if (!(err instanceof Ajv.ValidationError)) throw err;
  // data is invalid
  console.log('Validation errors:', err.errors);
});
```

### Using transpilers with asynchronous validation functions.

[ajv-async](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-async) uses [nodent](https://github.com/MatAtBread/nodent) to transpile async functions. To use another transpiler you should separately install it (or load its bundle in the browser).


#### Using nodent

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv;
require('ajv-async')(ajv);
// in the browser if you want to load ajv-async bundle separately you can:
// window.ajvAsync(ajv);
var validate = ajv.compile(schema); // transpiled es7 async function
validate(data).then(successFunc).catch(errorFunc);
```


#### Using other transpilers

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ processCode: transpileFunc });
var validate = ajv.compile(schema); // transpiled es7 async function
validate(data).then(successFunc).catch(errorFunc);
```

See [Options](#options).


## Security considerations

JSON Schema, if properly used, can replace data sanitisation. It doesn't replace other API security considerations. It also introduces additional security aspects to consider.


##### Security contact

To report a security vulnerability, please use the
[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).
Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure. Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities via GitHub issues.


##### Untrusted schemas

Ajv treats JSON schemas as trusted as your application code. This security model is based on the most common use case, when the schemas are static and bundled together with the application.

If your schemas are received from untrusted sources (or generated from untrusted data) there are several scenarios you need to prevent:
- compiling schemas can cause stack overflow (if they are too deep)
- compiling schemas can be slow (e.g. [#557](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/557))
- validating certain data can be slow

It is difficult to predict all the scenarios, but at the very least it may help to limit the size of untrusted schemas (e.g. limit JSON string length) and also the maximum schema object depth (that can be high for relatively small JSON strings). You also may want to mitigate slow regular expressions in `pattern` and `patternProperties` keywords.

Regardless the measures you take, using untrusted schemas increases security risks.


##### Circular references in JavaScript objects

Ajv does not support schemas and validated data that have circular references in objects. See [issue #802](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/802).

An attempt to compile such schemas or validate such data would cause stack overflow (or will not complete in case of asynchronous validation). Depending on the parser you use, untrusted data can lead to circular references.


##### Security risks of trusted schemas

Some keywords in JSON Schemas can lead to very slow validation for certain data. These keywords include (but may be not limited to):

- `pattern` and `format` for large strings - in some cases using `maxLength` can help mitigate it, but certain regular expressions can lead to exponential validation time even with relatively short strings (see [ReDoS attack](#redos-attack)).
- `patternProperties` for large property names - use `propertyNames` to mitigate, but some regular expressions can have exponential evaluation time as well.
- `uniqueItems` for large non-scalar arrays - use `maxItems` to mitigate

__Please note__: The suggestions above to prevent slow validation would only work if you do NOT use `allErrors: true` in production code (using it would continue validation after validation errors).

You can validate your JSON schemas against [this meta-schema](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/refs/json-schema-secure.json) to check that these recommendations are followed:

```javascript
const isSchemaSecure = ajv.compile(require('ajv/lib/refs/json-schema-secure.json'));

const schema1 = {format: 'email'};
isSchemaSecure(schema1); // false

const schema2 = {format: 'email', maxLength: MAX_LENGTH};
isSchemaSecure(schema2); // true
```

__Please note__: following all these recommendation is not a guarantee that validation of untrusted data is safe - it can still lead to some undesirable results.


##### Content Security Policies (CSP)
See [Ajv and Content Security Policies (CSP)](#ajv-and-content-security-policies-csp)


## ReDoS attack

Certain regular expressions can lead to the exponential evaluation time even with relatively short strings.

Please assess the regular expressions you use in the schemas on their vulnerability to this attack - see [safe-regex](https://github.com/substack/safe-regex), for example.

__Please note__: some formats that Ajv implements use [regular expressions](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/compile/formats.js) that can be vulnerable to ReDoS attack, so if you use Ajv to validate data from untrusted sources __it is strongly recommended__ to consider the following:

- making assessment of "format" implementations in Ajv.
- using `format: 'fast'` option that simplifies some of the regular expressions (although it does not guarantee that they are safe).
- replacing format implementations provided by Ajv with your own implementations of "format" keyword that either uses different regular expressions or another approach to format validation. Please see [addFormat](#api-addformat) method.
- disabling format validation by ignoring "format" keyword with option `format: false`

Whatever mitigation you choose, please assume all formats provided by Ajv as potentially unsafe and make your own assessment of their suitability for your validation scenarios.


## Filtering data

With [option `removeAdditional`](#options) (added by [andyscott](https://github.com/andyscott)) you can filter data during the validation.

This option modifies original data.

Example:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ removeAdditional: true });
var schema = {
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "number" },
    "bar": {
      "additionalProperties": { "type": "number" },
      "properties": {
        "baz": { "type": "string" }
      }
    }
  }
}

var data = {
  "foo": 0,
  "additional1": 1, // will be removed; `additionalProperties` == false
  "bar": {
    "baz": "abc",
    "additional2": 2 // will NOT be removed; `additionalProperties` != false
  },
}

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.log(data); // { "foo": 0, "bar": { "baz": "abc", "additional2": 2 }
```

If `removeAdditional` option in the example above were `"all"` then both `additional1` and `additional2` properties would have been removed.

If the option were `"failing"` then property `additional1` would have been removed regardless of its value and property `additional2` would have been removed only if its value were failing the schema in the inner `additionalProperties` (so in the example above it would have stayed because it passes the schema, but any non-number would have been removed).

__Please note__: If you use `removeAdditional` option with `additionalProperties` keyword inside `anyOf`/`oneOf` keywords your validation can fail with this schema, for example:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "oneOf": [
    {
      "properties": {
        "foo": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": [ "foo" ],
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    {
      "properties": {
        "bar": { "type": "integer" }
      },
      "required": [ "bar" ],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The intention of the schema above is to allow objects with either the string property "foo" or the integer property "bar", but not with both and not with any other properties.

With the option `removeAdditional: true` the validation will pass for the object `{ "foo": "abc"}` but will fail for the object `{"bar": 1}`. It happens because while the first subschema in `oneOf` is validated, the property `bar` is removed because it is an additional property according to the standard (because it is not included in `properties` keyword in the same schema).

While this behaviour is unexpected (issues [#129](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/129), [#134](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/134)), it is correct. To have the expected behaviour (both objects are allowed and additional properties are removed) the schema has to be refactored in this way:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "string" },
    "bar": { "type": "integer" }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "oneOf": [
    { "required": [ "foo" ] },
    { "required": [ "bar" ] }
  ]
}
```

The schema above is also more efficient - it will compile into a faster function.


## Assigning defaults

With [option `useDefaults`](#options) Ajv will assign values from `default` keyword in the schemas of `properties` and `items` (when it is the array of schemas) to the missing properties and items.

With the option value `"empty"` properties and items equal to `null` or `""` (empty string) will be considered missing and assigned defaults.

This option modifies original data.

__Please note__: the default value is inserted in the generated validation code as a literal, so the value inserted in the data will be the deep clone of the default in the schema.


Example 1 (`default` in `properties`):

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ useDefaults: true });
var schema = {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "number" },
    "bar": { "type": "string", "default": "baz" }
  },
  "required": [ "foo", "bar" ]
};

var data = { "foo": 1 };

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.log(data); // { "foo": 1, "bar": "baz" }
```

Example 2 (`default` in `items`):

```javascript
var schema = {
  "type": "array",
  "items": [
    { "type": "number" },
    { "type": "string", "default": "foo" }
  ]
}

var data = [ 1 ];

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.log(data); // [ 1, "foo" ]
```

`default` keywords in other cases are ignored:

- not in `properties` or `items` subschemas
- in schemas inside `anyOf`, `oneOf` and `not` (see [#42](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/42))
- in `if` subschema of `switch` keyword
- in schemas generated by custom macro keywords

The [`strictDefaults` option](#options) customizes Ajv's behavior for the defaults that Ajv ignores (`true` raises an error, and `"log"` outputs a warning).


## Coercing data types

When you are validating user inputs all your data properties are usually strings. The option `coerceTypes` allows you to have your data types coerced to the types specified in your schema `type` keywords, both to pass the validation and to use the correctly typed data afterwards.

This option modifies original data.

__Please note__: if you pass a scalar value to the validating function its type will be coerced and it will pass the validation, but the value of the variable you pass won't be updated because scalars are passed by value.


Example 1:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ coerceTypes: true });
var schema = {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "number" },
    "bar": { "type": "boolean" }
  },
  "required": [ "foo", "bar" ]
};

var data = { "foo": "1", "bar": "false" };

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.log(data); // { "foo": 1, "bar": false }
```

Example 2 (array coercions):

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({ coerceTypes: 'array' });
var schema = {
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "number" } },
    "bar": { "type": "boolean" }
  }
};

var data = { "foo": "1", "bar": ["false"] };

var validate = ajv.compile(schema);

console.log(validate(data)); // true
console.log(data); // { "foo": [1], "bar": false }
```

The coercion rules, as you can see from the example, are different from JavaScript both to validate user input as expected and to have the coercion reversible (to correctly validate cases where different types are defined in subschemas of "anyOf" and other compound keywords).

See [Coercion rules](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/COERCION.md) for details.


## API

##### new Ajv(Object options) -&gt; Object

Create Ajv instance.


##### .compile(Object schema) -&gt; Function&lt;Object data&gt;

Generate validating function and cache the compiled schema for future use.

Validating function returns a boolean value. This function has properties `errors` and `schema`. Errors encountered during the last validation are assigned to `errors` property (it is assigned `null` if there was no errors). `schema` property contains the reference to the original schema.

The schema passed to this method will be validated against meta-schema unless `validateSchema` option is false. If schema is invalid, an error will be thrown. See [options](#options).


##### <a name="api-compileAsync"></a>.compileAsync(Object schema [, Boolean meta] [, Function callback]) -&gt; Promise

Asynchronous version of `compile` method that loads missing remote schemas using asynchronous function in `options.loadSchema`. This function returns a Promise that resolves to a validation function. An optional callback passed to `compileAsync` will be called with 2 parameters: error (or null) and validating function. The returned promise will reject (and the callback will be called with an error) when:

- missing schema can't be loaded (`loadSchema` returns a Promise that rejects).
- a schema containing a missing reference is loaded, but the reference cannot be resolved.
- schema (or some loaded/referenced schema) is invalid.

The function compiles schema and loads the first missing schema (or meta-schema) until all missing schemas are loaded.

You can asynchronously compile meta-schema by passing `true` as the second parameter.

See example in [Asynchronous compilation](#asynchronous-schema-compilation).


##### .validate(Object schema|String key|String ref, data) -&gt; Boolean

Validate data using passed schema (it will be compiled and cached).

Instead of the schema you can use the key that was previously passed to `addSchema`, the schema id if it was present in the schema or any previously resolved reference.

Validation errors will be available in the `errors` property of Ajv instance (`null` if there were no errors).

__Please note__: every time this method is called the errors are overwritten so you need to copy them to another variable if you want to use them later.

If the schema is asynchronous (has `$async` keyword on the top level) this method returns a Promise
