## Please [sponsor Ajv development](https://github.com/sponsors/epoberezkin)

I will get straight to the point - I need your support to ensure that the development of Ajv continues.

I have developed Ajv for 5 years in my free time, but it is not  sustainable. I'd appreciate if you consider supporting its further development with donations:
- [GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/epoberezkin) (GitHub will match it)
- [Ajv Open CollectiveÔ∏è](https://opencollective.com/ajv)

There are many small and large improvements that are long due, including the support of the next versions of JSON Schema specification, improving website and documentation, and making Ajv more modular and maintainable to address its limitations - what Ajv needs to evolve is much more than what I can contribute in my free time.

I would also really appreciate any advice you could give on how to raise funds for Ajv development - whether some suitable open-source fund I could apply to or some sponsor I should approach.

Since 2015 Ajv has become widely used, thanks to your help and contributions:

- **90** contributors üèó
- **5,000** dependent npm packages ‚öôÔ∏è
- **7,000** github stars, from GitHub users [all over the world](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1MGRV8ciFUGIbO1l0EKFWNJGYE7iSkDxP&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C4.821737100000007&z=2) ‚≠êÔ∏è
- **5,000,000** dependent repositories on GitHub üöÄ
- **120,000,000** npm downloads per month! üíØ

I believe it would benefit all Ajv users to help put together the fund that will be used for its further development - it would allow to bring some additional maintainers to the project.

Thank you

## Using version 6

[JSON Schema draft-07](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html) is published.

[Ajv version 6.0.0](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/releases/tag/v6.0.0) that supports draft-07 is released. It may require either migrating your schemas or updating your code (to continue using draft-04 and v5 schemas, draft-06 schemas will be supported without changes).

__Please note__: To use Ajv with draft-06 schemas you need to explicitly add the meta-schema to the validator instance:

```javascript
ajv.addMetaSchema(require('ajv/lib/refs/json-schema-draft-06.json'));
```

To use Ajv with draft-04 schemas in addition to explicitly adding meta-schema you also need to use option schemaId:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({schemaId: 'id'});
// If you want to use both draft-04 and draft-06/07 schemas:
// var ajv = new Ajv({schemaId: 'auto'});
ajv.addMetaSchema(require('ajv/lib/refs/json-schema-draft-04.json'));
```

## Performance

Ajv generates code using [doT templates](https://github.com/olado/doT) to turn JSON Schemas into super-fast validation functions that are efficient for v8 optimization.

Currently Ajv is the fastest and the most standard compliant validator according to these benchmarks:

- [json-schema-benchmark](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark) - 50% faster than the second place
- [jsck benchmark](https://github.com/pandastrike/jsck#benchmarks) - 20-190% faster
- [z-schema benchmark](https://rawgit.com/zaggino/z-schema/master/benchmark/results.html)
- [themis benchmark](https://cdn.rawgit.com/playlyfe/themis/master/benchmark/results.html)

- [asynchronous loading](#asynchronous-schema-compilation) of referenced schemas during compilation
- "All errors" validation mode with [option allErrors](#options)
- [error messages with parameters](#validation-errors) describing error reasons to allow creating custom error messages
- i18n error messages support with [ajv-i18n](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-i18n) package
- [filtering data](#filtering-data) from additional properties
- [assigning defaults](#assigning-defaults) to missing properties and items
- [coercing data](#coercing-data-types) to the types specified in `type` keywords
- [custom keywords](#defining-custom-keywords)
- draft-06/07 keywords `const`, `contains`, `propertyNames` and `if/then/else`
- draft-06 boolean schemas (`true`/`false` as a schema to always pass/fail).
- keywords `switch`, `patternRequired`, `formatMaximum` / `formatMinimum` and `formatExclusiveMaximum` / `formatExclusiveMinimum` from [JSON Schema extension proposals](https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/wiki/v5-Proposals) with [ajv-keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-keywords) package
- [$data reference](#data-reference) to use values from the validated data as values for the schema keywords
- [asynchronous validation](#asynchronous-validation) of custom formats and keywords

Currently Ajv is the only validator that passes all the tests from [JSON Schema Test Suite](https://github.com/json-schema/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite) (according to [json-schema-benchmark](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark), apart from the test that requires that `1.0` is not an integer that is impossible to satisfy in JavaScript).


## Install

```
npm install ajv
```


## <a name="usage"></a>Getting started

Try it in the Node.js REPL: https://tonicdev.com/npm/ajv


The fastest validation call:

```javascript
// Node.js require:
var Ajv = require('ajv');
// or ESM/TypeScript import
import Ajv from 'ajv';

var ajv = new Ajv(); // options can be passed, e.g. {allErrors: true}
var validate = ajv.compile(schema);
var valid = validate(data);
if (!valid) console.log(validate.errors);
```

or with less code

```javascript
// ...
var valid = ajv.validate(schema, data);
if (!valid) console.log(ajv.errors);
// ...
```

or

```javascript
// ...
var valid = ajv.addSchema(schema, 'mySchema')
               .validate('mySchema', data);
if (!valid) console.log(ajv.errorsText());
// ...
```

See [API](#api) and [Options](#options) for more details.

Ajv compiles schemas to functions and caches them in all cases (using schema serialized with [fast-json-stable-stringify](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-json-stable-stringify) or a custom function as a key), so that the next time the same schema is used (not necessarily the same object instance) it won't be compiled again.

The best performance is achieved when using compiled functions returned by `compile` or `getSchema` methods (there is no additional function call).

__Please note__: every time a validation function or `ajv.validate` are called `errors` property is overwritten. You need to copy `errors` array reference to another variable if you want to use it later (e.g., in the callback). See [Validation errors](#validation-errors)

__Note for TypeScript users__: `ajv` provides its own TypeScript declarations
out of the box, so you don't need to install the deprecated `@types/ajv`
module.


## Using in browser

You can require Ajv directly from the code you browserify - in this case Ajv will be a part of your bundle.

If you need to use Ajv in several bundles you can create a separate UMD bundle using `npm run bundle` script (thanks to [siddo420](https://github.com/siddo420)).

Then you need to load Ajv in the browser:
```html
<script src="ajv.min.js"></script>
```

This bundle can be used with different module systems; it creates global `Ajv` if no module system is found.

The browser bundle is available on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/ajv).

Ajv is tested with these browsers:

[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/epoberezkin.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/epoberezkin)

__Please note__: some frameworks, e.g. Dojo, may redefine global require in such way that is not compatible with CommonJS module format. In such case Ajv bundle has to be loaded before the framework and then you can use global Ajv (see issue [#234](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/issues/234)).


### Ajv and Content Security Policies (CSP)

If you're using Ajv to compile a schema (the typical use) in a browser document that is loaded with a Content Security Policy (CSP), that policy will require a `script-src` directive that includes the value `'unsafe-eval'`.
:warning: NOTE, however, that `unsafe-eval` is NOT recommended in a secure CSP[[1]](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy#relaxing-eval), as it has the potential to open the document to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

In order to make use of Ajv without easing your CSP, you can [pre-compile a schema using the CLI](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli#compile-schemas). This will transpile the schema JSON into a JavaScript file that exports a `validate` function that works simlarly to a schema compiled at runtime.

Note that pre-compilation of schemas is performed using [ajv-pack](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-pack) and there are [some limitations to the schema features it can compile](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-pack#limitations). A successfully pre-compiled schema is equivalent to the same schema compiled at runtime.


## Command line interface

CLI is available as a separate npm package [ajv-cli](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli). It supports:

- compiling JSON Schemas to test their validity
- BETA: generating standalone module exporting a validation function to be used without Ajv (using [ajv-pack](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-pack))
- migrate schemas to draft-07 (using [json-schema-migrate](https://github.com/epoberezkin/json-schema-migrate))
- validating data file(s) against JSON Schema
- testing expected validity of data against JSON Schema
- referenced schemas
- custom meta-schemas
- files in JSON, JSON5, YAML, and JavaScript format
- all Ajv options
- reporting changes in data after validation in [JSON-patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) format


## Validation keywords

Ajv supports all validation keywords from draft-07 of JSON Schema standard:

- [type](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#type)
- [for numbers](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-numbers) - maximum, minimum, exclusiveMaximum, exclusiveMinimum, multipleOf
- [for strings](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-strings) - maxLength, minLength, pattern, format
- [for arrays](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-arrays) - maxItems, minItems, uniqueItems, items, additionalItems, [contains](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#contains)
- [for objects](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-objects) - maxProperties, minProperties, required, properties, patternProperties, additionalProperties, dependencies, [propertyNames](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#propertynames)
- [for all types](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#keywords-for-all-types) - enum, [const](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#const)
- [compound keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#compound-keywords) - not, oneOf, anyOf, allOf, [if/then/else](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#ifthenelse)

With [ajv-keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-keywords) package Ajv also supports validation keywords from [JSON Schema extension proposals](https://github.com/json-schema/json-schema/wiki/v5-Proposals) for JSON Schema standard:

- [patternRequired](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#patternrequired-proposed) - like `required` but with patterns that some property should match.
- [formatMaximum, formatMinimum, formatExclusiveMaximum, formatExclusiveMinimum](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md#formatmaximum--formatminimum-and-exclusiveformatmaximum--exclusiveformatminimum-proposed) - setting limits for date, time, etc.

See [JSON Schema validation keywords](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/KEYWORDS.md) for more details.


## Annotation keywords

JSON Schema specification defines several annotation keywords that describe schema itself but do not perform any validation.

- `title` and `description`: information about the data represented by that schema
- `$comment` (NEW in draft-07): information for developers. With option `$comment` Ajv logs or passes the comment string to the user-supplied function. See [Options](#options).
- `default`: a default value of the data instance, see [Assigning defaults](#assigning-defaults).
- `examples` (NEW in draft-06): an array of data instances. Ajv does not check the validity of these instances against the schema.
- `readOnly` and `writeOnly` (NEW in draft-07): marks data-instance as read-only or write-only in relation to the source of the data (database, api, etc.).
- `contentEncoding`: [RFC 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.1 ), e.g., "base64".
- `contentMediaType`: [RFC 2046](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046), e.g., "image/png".

__Please note__:  Ajv does not implement validation of the keywords `examples`, `contentEncoding` and `contentMediaType` but it reserves them. If you want to create a plugin that implements some of them, it should remove these keywords from the instance.


## Formats

Ajv implements formats defined by JSON Schema specification and several other formats. It is recommended NOT to use "format" keyword implementations with untrusted data, as they use potentially unsafe regular expressions - see [ReDoS attack](#redos-attack).

__Please note__: if you need to use "format" keyword to validate untrusted data, you MUST assess their suitability and safety for your validation scenarios.

The following formats are implemented for string validation with "format" keyword:

- _date_: full-date according to [RFC3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).
- _time_: time with optional time-zone.
- _date-time_: date-time from the same source (time-zone is mandatory). `date`, `time` and `date-time` validate ranges in `full` mode and only regexp in `fast` mode (see [options](#options)).
- _uri_: full URI.
- _uri-reference_: URI reference, including full and relative URIs.
- _uri-template_: URI template according to [RFC6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570)
- _url_ (deprecated): [URL record](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url).
- _email_: email address.
- _hostname_: host name according to [RFC1034](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.5).
- _ipv4_: IP address v4.
- _ipv6_: IP address v6.
- _regex_: tests whether a string is a valid regular expression by passing it to RegExp constructor.
- _uuid_: Universally Unique IDentifier according to [RFC4122](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122).
- _json-pointer_: JSON-pointer according to [RFC6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).
- _relative-json-pointer_: relative JSON-pointer according to [this draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-luff-relative-json-pointer-00).

__Please note__: JSON Schema draft-07 also defines formats `iri`, `iri-reference`, `idn-hostname` and `idn-email` for URLs, hostnames and emails with international characters. Ajv does not implement these formats. If you create Ajv plugin that implements them please make a PR to mention this plugin here.

There are two modes of format validation: `fast` and `full`. This mode affects formats `date`, `time`, `date-time`, `uri`, `uri-reference`, and `email`. See [Options](#options) for details.

You can add additional formats and replace any of the formats above using [addFormat](#api-addformat) method.

The option `unknownFormats` allows changing the default behaviour when an unknown format is encountered. In this case Ajv can either fail schema compilation (default) or ignore it (default in versions before 5.0.0). You also can whitelist specific format(s) to be ignored. See [Options](#options) for details.

You can find regular expressions used for format validation and the sources that were used in [formats.js](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/lib/compile/formats.js).


## <a name="ref"></a>Combining schemas with $ref

You can structure your validation logic across multiple schema files and have schemas reference each other using `$ref` keyword.

Example:

```javascript
var schema = {
  "$id": "http://example.com/schemas/schema.json",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "foo": { "$ref": "defs.json#/definitions/int" },
    "bar": { "$ref": "defs.json#/definitions/str" }
  }
};

var defsSchema = {
  "$id": "http://example.com/schemas/defs.json",
  "definitions": {
    "int": { "type": "integer" },
    "str": { "type": "string" }
  }
};
```

Now to compile your schema you can either pass all schemas to Ajv instance:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({schemas: [schema, defsSchema]});
var validate = ajv.getSchema('http://example.com/schemas/schema.json');
```

or use `addSchema` method:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv;
var validate = ajv.addSchema(defsSchema)
                  .compile(schema);
```

See [Options](#options) and [addSchema](#api) method.

__Please note__:
- `$ref` is resolved as the uri-reference using schema $id as the base URI (see the example).
- References can be recursive (and mutually recursive) to implement the schemas for different data structures (such as linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.).
- You don't have to host your schema files at the URIs that you use as schema $id. These URIs are only used to identify the schemas, and according to JSON Schema specification validators should not expect to be able to download the schemas from these URIs.
- The actual location of the schema file in the file system is not used.
- You can pass the identifier of the schema as the second parameter of `addSchema` method or as a property name in `schemas` option. This identifier can be used instead of (or in addition to) schema $id.
- You cannot have the same $id (or the schema identifier) used for more than one schema - the exception will be thrown.
- You can implement dynamic resolution of the referenced schemas using `compileAsync` method. In this way you can store schemas in any system (files, web, database, etc.) and reference them without explicitly adding to Ajv instance. See [Asynchronous schema compilation](#asynchronous-schema-compilation).


## $data reference

With `$data` option you can use values from the validated data as the values for the schema keywords. See [proposal](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/51) for more information about how it works.

`$data` reference is supported in the keywords: const, enum, format, maximum/minimum, exclusiveMaximum / exclusiveMinimum, maxLength / minLength, maxItems / minItems, maxProperties / minProperties, formatMaximum / formatMinimum, formatExclusiveMaximum / formatExclusiveMinimum, multipleOf, pattern, required, uniqueItems.

The value of "$data" should be a [JSON-pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to the data (the root is always the top level data object, even if the $data reference is inside a referenced subschema) or a [relative JSON-pointer](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-luff-relative-json-pointer-00) (it is relative to the current point in data; if the $data reference is inside a referenced subschema it cannot point to the data outside of the root level for this subschema).

Examples.

This schema requires that the value in property `smaller` is less or equal than the value in the property larger:

```javascript
var ajv = new Ajv({$data: true});

var schema = {
  "properties": {
    "smaller": {
      "type": "number",
      "maximum": { "$data": "1/larger" }
    },
    "larger": { "type": "number" }
  }
};

var validData = {
  smaller: 5,
  larger: 7
};

ajv.validate(schema, validData); // true
```

This schema requires that the properties have the same format as their field names:

```javascript
var schema = {
  "additionalProperties": {
    "type": "string",
    "format": { "$data": "0#" }
  }
};

var validData = {
  'date-time': '1
